## The pipeline approach

We can solve Outbreak Analytics tasks with sets of packages integrated in pipelines.

Outbreak analytics can be viewed as a set of data analysis __Tasks__ (@fig-tasks). In more detail, each of these Tasks are connected by their data inputs and outputs (@fig-tasks-detailed). 

### Tasks

### Pipelines

We defined a __Pipeline__ as a set of connected Tasks required to obtain an informative outcome for decision-making purposes. For example, estimate the time-varying transmission (@fig-pipe-01), or project the final size (@fig-pipe-02) of an epidemic.
